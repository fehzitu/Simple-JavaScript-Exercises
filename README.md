## ðŸ§  JavaScript Basics Test

This repository contains my answers to a set of JavaScript exercises designed to test fundamental knowledge of the language.  
Each file corresponds to a different question or concept â€” similar to what you might find in a basic JavaScript skills assessment.

This project was created to:
- Practice and reinforce my understanding of **core JavaScript concepts**.

- Serve as a reference for other learners studying the basics of JS.

## ðŸ§© Topics Covered

- Variables and data types
